<h1>Privacy Policy for SIFS</h1>
<p class="muted">Last updated: 2025-10-23</p>
<p>This Privacy Policy describes how SIFS (“we”, “us”, or “our”) collects, uses, and shares information when you use the <strong>SIFS</strong> Android application (“App”).</p>
<p>If you do not agree with this policy, please do not use the App.</p>
<hr>
<h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
<h3>1.1 Camera and Photos</h3>
<ul>
<li>The App may request access to your <strong>camera</strong> (<code>android.permission.CAMERA</code>) to let you capture images/videos within the App.</li>
<li>Images and videos you capture are used <strong>only</strong> to provide the in‑app feature you initiated (e.g., attaching a photo to a record).</li>
</ul>
<h3>1.2 Files &amp; Media</h3>
<ul>
<li>If you choose an image/video from your device, the App needs temporary access to that file. We do <strong>not</strong> scan or collect other media on your device.</li>
</ul>
<h3>1.3 Usage Data</h3>
<ul>
<li>We may collect basic, non‑identifying diagnostics (e.g., crash logs, performance). This helps us improve the App.</li>
</ul>
<p>We do <strong>not</strong> sell personal information. We do not collect precise location unless explicitly requested for a feature.</p>
<hr>
<h2>2. How We Use Information</h2>
<ul>
<li>To enable features like capturing or attaching photos/videos.</li>
<li>To provide support and improve reliability and performance.</li>
<li>To comply with legal obligations.</li>
</ul>
<h2>3. Sharing of Information</h2>
<p>We do not share your personal information with third parties except:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Service providers</strong> that process data on our behalf (e.g., analytics or crash reporting), under confidentiality obligations.</li>
<li><strong>Legal reasons</strong>, if required by law or to protect our rights.</li>
</ul>
<h2>4. Data Storage &amp; Retention</h2>
<ul>
<li>Media you capture may be uploaded to our servers <strong>only</strong> if required by the feature you use. Otherwise it remains on your device.</li>
<li>We retain uploaded content only as long as needed for the purpose it was collected or as required by law.</li>
</ul>
<h2>5. Your Choices</h2>
<ul>
<li>You can <strong>deny camera permission</strong> in Android settings. Some features may not work without it.</li>
<li>You can delete content you created inside the App where supported.</li>
</ul>
<h2>6. Children’s Privacy</h2>
<p>The App is <strong>not directed to children under 13</strong>. If you believe a child has provided us information, contact us and we will delete it.</p>
<h2>7. Security</h2>

<h2>8. International Transfers</h2>
<p>Your information may be processed in countries other than your own. By using the App you consent to such transfers subject to applicable law.</p>
<h2>9. Changes to This Policy</h2>
